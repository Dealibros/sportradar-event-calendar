2. A database following the structure of the ERD.

- Database connection

- SQL query

- Data Output

3. A HTML frontend to display the data in a user-friendly way.Â 

## Technologies
The application will be built using the following technologies:

- Next.js
- React.js
- PostgreSQL
- Figma

## Libraries
- ley
- date-fns
- fontawesome


## Getting Started
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
